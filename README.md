I found this data set interesting since I always love to see LGBTQ+ representation in media, especially in animated films and cartoons. 
Questions I hope to answer:
1.What kind of genres are LGBTQ+ characters more represented in?
2.What audience are LGBTQ+ characters primarily shown to (TV14, TVMA, etc)?
3.How long do shows with LGBTQ+ characters tend to last?
4.Are LGBTQ+ character fairly represented among the age groups?
5.Is there an age group lacking representation?
6.What kind of media is showing more LGBTQ+ characters: tv shows or movies?
7.What kind of storyline surrounds LGBTQ+ characters (fantasy, slice of life, etc)?
8.What kind of IMDB rating do shows with LGBTQ+ representation tend to get?
9.What is the viewership of these shows like?
10.What networks tend to have shows with LGBTQ+ representation?
